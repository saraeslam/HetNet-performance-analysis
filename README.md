## Abstract
Recent simulations and performance analysis of mmWave-HetNets have shown favorable Signal to Interference and Noise Ratio (SINR) coverage and rate coverage for sub-urban environments. These simulations however, unrealistically, do not account for the elevation angle of the Base Station beam alignment. This project involves realization of a more realistic model via 3D channel modelling and subsequently a more accurate investigation into the coverage and rate trends in a downlink transmission scheme of hybrid cellular networks.
