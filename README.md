## Abstract
Next generation cellular networks have various enablers. This project studies the following 3 enablers in the context of a three tier mmWave - microWave network:
- Heterogenity
- Decoupled Access
- mmWave

Performance metrics like system coverage and data-rate are evaluated under different system configurations and the observed trends and trade-offs are discussed.
